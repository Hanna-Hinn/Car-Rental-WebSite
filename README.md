# Car-Rental-WebSite
This is a car rental website that I have built while learning front-end development. The language that was used for making the website is Reactjs along side with it's concepts including react Context, hooks, route, and lazy load. I used firebase as the backend services. Some external libraries where included such as Material UI, PropTypes , axios and ag-grid.
